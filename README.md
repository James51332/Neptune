# Neptune
A modern game engine written in C++17.

## Features

Not much is currently implemented in Neptune. Currently, we are working on creating a strong foundation for a powerful engine to be built on top of. This includes utilities, debugging tools, etc.

## Roadmap

Neptune is constantly-changing and evolving and the tasks that are next to be developed are most accurately documented on our [Trello page](https://trello.com/b/ktXv9ame/neptune). However, here are some of the main features to come:

* Efficent 3D Renderer
* Batched 2D Renderer
* ECS
* GUI Libary
* Editor
